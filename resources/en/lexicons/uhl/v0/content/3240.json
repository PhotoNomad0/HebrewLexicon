{"brief":"deposit","long":"source: a primitive root;\nmeaning: to \"deposit\"; by implication, to \"allow to stay\"\nusage: bestow, cast down, lay (down, up), leave (off), let alone (remain), pacify, place, put, set (down), suffer, withdraw, withhold. (The Hiphil forms with the dagesh are here referred to, in accordance with the older grammarians; but if any distinction of the kind is to be made, these should rather be referred to \"H5117\", and the others here.)\n"}
