{"brief":"desire","long":"source: presumed to be the 'constructive' or genitival form of \"אַו\" ; short for \"H185\";\nmeaning: \"desire\" (and so probably in Proverbs 31:4); hence (by way of alternative) \"or\", also \"if\"\nusage: also, and, either, if, at the least, × nor, or, otherwise, then, whether.\n"}
