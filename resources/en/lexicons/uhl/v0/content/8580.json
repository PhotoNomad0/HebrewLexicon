{"brief":"hard breather","long":"source: from \"H5395\";\nmeaning: properly, a \"hard breather\", i.e. the name of two unclean creatures, a \"lizard\" and a \"bird\" (both perhaps from changing color through their irascibility), probably the \"tree-toad\" and the \"water-hen\"\nusage: mole, swan.\n"}
